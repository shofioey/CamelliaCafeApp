# Camellia Cafe Ordering System

This is a JavaFX application for the Camellia Cafe ordering system.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later (You have Java 21).
- **JavaFX SDK** (Required separately as it's not included in standard JDKs).

## How to Set Up
1. Download the JavaFX SDK for Windows (x64) from [GluonHQ](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
2. Extract the downloaded zip file to a location (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-21.0.6`).
3. Note the path to the `lib` folder inside the extracted SDK (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-21.0.6\lib`).

## How to Compile and Run
I have provided a `run.bat` script. You need to edit it to point to your JavaFX SDK location.

1. Right-click `run.bat` and select **Edit**.
2. Change the value of `PATH_TO_FX` to your actual JavaFX `lib` folder path.
   Example: `set PATH_TO_FX="C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-21.0.6\lib"`
3. Save the file.
4. Double-click `run.bat` to compile and run the application.
